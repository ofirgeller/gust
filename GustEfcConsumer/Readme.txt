# Project for testing gust.

* Not mature, needs more testing to prove Gust handles a variety of types and reletionships 
* Requires a local postgres DB with a specific password to run (see BloggerContext for the expected username&password)
* Unit tests are inside of this project since we are not testing the project itself, you can use this project both 
  as a console app and as a unit test source
